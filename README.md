## 1. Kill the k-th bit

In order to stop the Mad Coder evil genius you need to decipher the encrypted message he sent to his minions. The message contains several numbers that, when typed into a supercomputer, will launch a missile into the sky blocking out the sun, and making all the people on Earth grumpy and sad.

You figured out that some numbers have a modified single digit in their binary representation. More specifically, in the given number `n` the `k-th` bit from the right was initially set to `0`, but its current value might be different. It's now up to you to write a function that will change the `k-th` bit of `n` back to `0`.

### Example

- For `n = 37` and `k = 3`, the output should be
`killKthBit(n, k) = 33`.

<pre>37<sub>10</sub> = 100101<sub>2</sub> ~> 100001<sub>2</sub> = 33<sub>10</sub></pre>

- For `n = 37` and `k = 4`, the output should be
`killKthBit(n, k) = 37`.

The `4-th` bit is `0` already (looks like the Mad Coder forgot to encrypt this number), so the answer is still `37`.


### Input/Output

- **[input] integer n**

Guaranteed constraints:
`0 ≤ n ≤ 231 - 1`.

- **[input] integer k**

The 1-based index of the changed bit (counting from the right).

Guaranteed constraints:
`1 ≤ k ≤ 31`.

- **[output] integer**

## 2. Array Packing

You are given an array of up to four non-negative integers, each less than `256`.

Your task is to pack these integers into one number `M` in the following way:

- The first element of the array occupies the first `8` bits of `M`;
- The second element occupies next `8` bits, and so on.

Return the obtained integer `M`.

**Note:** the phrase "first bits of M" refers to the least significant bits of M - the right-most bits of an integer. For further clarification see the following example.

### Example

For `a = [24, 85, 0]`, the output should be
`arrayPacking(a) = 21784`.

An array `[24, 85, 0]` looks like `[00011000, 01010101, 00000000]` in binary.
After packing these into one number we get `00000000 01010101 00011000` (spaces are placed for convenience), which equals to `21784`.

### Input/Output

- **[input] array.integer a**

Guaranteed constraints:
`1 ≤ a.length ≤ 4`,
`0 ≤ a[i] < 256`.

- **[output] integer**

## 3. Range bit count

You are given two numbers `a` and `b` where `0 ≤ a ≤ b`. Imagine you construct an array of all the integers from `a` to `b` inclusive. You need to count the number of 1s in the binary representations of all the numbers in the array.

### Example

For `a = 2` and `b = 7`, the output should be
`rangeBitCount(a, b) = 11`.

Given `a = 2` and `b = 7` the array is: `[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`. Converting the numbers to binary, we get `[10, 11, 100, 101, 110, 111]`, which contains `1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 3 = 11` 1s.

### Input/Output

- **[input] integer a**

Guaranteed constraints:
`0 ≤ a ≤ b`.

- **[input] integer b**

Guaranteed constraints:
`a ≤ b ≤ 10`.

- **[output] integer**

## 4. Mirror Bits

Reverse the order of the bits in a given integer.

### Example

- For `a = 97`, the output should be
`mirrorBits(a) = 67`.

`97` equals to `1100001` in binary, which is `1000011` after mirroring, and that is `67` in base `10`.

- For `a = 8`, the output should be
`mirrorBits(a) = 1`.

### Input/Output

- **[input] integer a**

Guaranteed constraints:
`5 ≤ a ≤ 105`.

- **[output] integer**
